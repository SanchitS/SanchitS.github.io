                        <p>If it has some fees or requires payment then the user become skeptic about it's worth and costs more time looking for the answers to his questions before making any payment.

                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500 ">TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS - </span> A Website with a name related to courses(CourseALL, this is what we are calling it now). This can be made using HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend and for that I have an amazing friend, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshav-dhawan-897722101">Keshav Dhawan</a> onboard who has a brilliant knowledge in the frontend area and for the backend, a database, and JS will be required.</p>

                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">CONTENT REQUIREMENTS- </span> This is the biggest hurdle actually as it is very much difficult to judge a course and rank it as number 1 or rate it as the best when there are other contenders too. Practically, there is no way by which we can take one name in hand and yell it as the most awesome course of a particular thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>But there can be factors on the basis of which this judgement can be done. It can be ratings on the particular website, ratings on other websites, popularity on the particular website and popularity on other sites, author or instructor's popularity on social media sites, ratings of the course on the site and on other blogs. There are many blogs available on the web which talk about the courses and also on the other side they talk about their own course but instead of picking the course we can pick rating and reviews from their own site and other sites.</p>
                        <p>To gather the content is the most challenging step but for now, we want to focus on the most recommended courses and we will gather the information available online on most popular websites and blogs like medium, quora etc.</p>

                            <p><b>Must - </b> For now the primary task is to sort out many options and to chose top 5 recommended courses(based on price, popularity, ease of access and many more factors) and to put it in front of the world and especially the needy user so that without wasting time he can navigate to the site and start learning.</p>
                            <p><b>Should - </b> If we will have time then we will integrate the ratings and reviews available of that course so that we and that course card can gain more trust of the user and user will feel sure to jump to the site.</p>
                            <p><b>Could - </b>Presently it is necessary to provide the basic solution on the basis of which one can take decision easily so, for now, there will be only 5 choices but later we will emphasize it in scaling up and adding more data so oriented so that the percentage of surety of whether the most recommended course is really the best or not will increase.</p>
                            <p><b>Would - </b>For a better UX, the next step will be to provide the comparing option between the similar type of courses. As if a guy wants to compare two similar courses available for the learning of <i>AngularJS framework</i> then the user can easily compare the two courses and can judge better as which one to opt(these judging factors will include the description, difficulty level, price or fees, duration, assignments, certification, instructor's profile and many more elements). </p>

                        <p>Then I tried to narrow down the every part and fill it with details. Okay! Let's do it then. It was looking somewhat like this. </p>

                        <div class="row">

                        <p>I tried to narrow down each and everything and there were some hurdles that I counted and I figured out the solutions but there are still some whose solution is quite ambiguous. Anyways main thing was search, from the technical end I'll make it huge by keeping it selective and for that it will need huge amount of data into the backend(we are preparing that) and the cards look, expanded cards' look and lastly the footer. there are still many things which will add and get subtracted from the footer.</p>

                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">WIREFRAME - </span> It is a basic product that I want to focus right now and for that I made sketches so that I can do a gorilla testing on the pages and ask the fellow users whether they have like the flow, the ease of use, the content and everything on the internet or not.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To make the UI part here I am taking the help of the sketches, gorilla testing because it can save my time and money and if these two things can be saved then it can be used later to create a better MVP.

                        <p>Firstly I made the sketch of the landing page because it was necessary. It was a rough sketch to get the idea and to decide and validate the whole flow as whether I have been following my own made decisions well or not. After analyzing it for a while I went for the actual sketches of the pages that how the screens will look. Even after making that I did go for the gorilla testing and asked for the presence of those people again who were in the role of defining the hassle of finding best course to test the product's idea and when I succeeded I moved to the UI part. But first, let's have a look at the sketches of the screens.</p>

                    <p>Now you know how the designed product looked like in actual and by the above data provided, you can make a guess that how the product's UI will look like.
                    </p>

                    <p>I HAVE JUST DELETED THE UIs OF THIS COURSEALL AS THE THEME HAS BEEN CHANGED AND I HAVE TO MAKE SOME ALTERATIONS. IT'LL BE UPDATED SOON.</p>

                    <p>This is how the product is looking at the end of the designing partAnd to test it worldwide I want to use the method that was defined in the book "LEAN UX" by Jeff Gothelf on page number 70 named as CONCIERGE MVP.</p>

                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="centered col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 mt30 mb30 ">

                            <p class="ux-text">LEAN UX pg-70</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <p>Just like in this method the way of testing is great and the product being incomplete then too providing the good UX. For the courseALL I think I am going to opt this way as it is easy to implement and can be tested early when the product is in the development phase. It'll give the insights of the people and from the feedback we can get down to the conclusion as whther this product is actually required in the world or not.</p>
