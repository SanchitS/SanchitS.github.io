                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">OBJECTIVE - </span> To prepare an online platform (for now, a web solution) which can recommend the best course of anything available online. And using this any user can search, select and start the course without wasting time hunting for the best solution on the web.</p>


                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">BUSINESS NEEDS - </span>A website, efficiently made and also fast enough with a good UX so that a person can choose a course from the options available or by searching directly and comparing with other similar courses available online on different websites. These courses will be displayed in the order of recommendations and one can easily sort it and also filter out and opt whichever course he find useful .
                        </p>


                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">USER NEEDS - </span> I am also a user and I have been through this phase many times. it is really very difficult to choose a particular course amongst thousands of others available which are claiming to be the best and comprised with best sources and instructor. It is really a time taking and a frustrating task to choose one out of many options when you want to learn something through the web. </p>
                        <p>If it has some fees or requires payment then the user become skeptic about it's worth and costs more time looking for the answers to his questions before making any payment. So to alter and narrow down this time-taking-window, the user can reach the end where he can get the best available options and select one amongst many efficiently and can go further and proceed to learn without any second wasting.

                        </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500 ">TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS - </span> A Website with a name related to courses(CourseALL, this is what we are calling it now). This can be made using HTML, CSS, and JS for the frontend and for that I have an amazing friend, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keshav-dhawan-897722101">Keshav Dhawan</a> onboard who has a brilliant knowledge in the frontend area and for the backend, a database, and JS will be required.</p>

                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">CONTENT REQUIREMENTS- </span> This is the biggest hurdle actually as it is very much difficult to judge a course and rank it as number 1 or rate it as the best when there are other contenders too. Practically, there is no way by which we can take one name in hand and yell it as the most awesome course of a particular thing.
                        </p>
                        <p>But there can be factors on the basis of which this judgement can be done. It can be ratings on the particular website, ratings on other websites, popularity on the particular website and popularity on other sites, author or instructor's popularity on social media sites, ratings of the course on the site and on other blogs. There are many blogs available on the web which talk about the courses and also on the other side they talk about their own course but instead of picking the course we can pick rating and reviews from their own site and other sites.</p>
                        <p>To gather the content is the most challenging step but for now, we want to focus on the most recommended courses and we will gather the information available online on most popular websites and blogs like medium, quora etc.</p>

                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">MoSCoW - </span> </p>

                            <p><b>Must - </b> For now the primary task is to sort out many options and to chose top 5 recommended courses(based on price, popularity, ease of access and many more factors) and to put it in front of the world and especially the needy user so that without wasting time he can navigate to the site and start learning.</p>
                            <p><b>Should - </b> If we will have time then we will integrate the ratings and reviews available of that course so that we and that course card can gain more trust of the user and user will feel sure to jump to the site.</p>
                            <p><b>Could - </b>Presently it is necessary to provide the basic solution on the basis of which one can take decision easily so, for now, there will be only 5 choices but later we will emphasize it in scaling up and adding more data so oriented so that the percentage of surety of whether the most recommended course is really the best or not will increase.</p>
                            <p><b>Would - </b>For a better UX, the next step will be to provide the comparing option between the similar type of courses. As if a guy wants to compare two similar courses available for the learning of <i>AngularJS framework</i> then the user can easily compare the two courses and can judge better as which one to opt(these judging factors will include the description, difficulty level, price or fees, duration, assignments, certification, instructor's profile and many more elements). </p>

                        <p>At this point we were focussing on both the ways of consultation as immediate one with the normal physician where the user will not be having choice and he will get the doctor randomly and another one was to schedule a consultation where according to the needs user can choose the doctor from the list where sorting and searching are available too.</p>
                        <p>Prepared the rough flow first so that we can put the missing points in our bucket and can consider it later. After that the proper conceptual model with total information(although it does have some missing points at that point) was made.</p>

                        <p>After having a brainstorming session with two more people we stepped on the very next step to prepare the wireframes of the product. We were in a position to make the blueprint also but there were so many up-downs on the chart.</p>
                        <p>Preparing the wireframes with the proper was my idea as instead of stepping directly onto the UIs I wanted to have a discussion over this low fidelity wireframes' flow. </p>

<p>Earlier we were focussing on both ways (instant and scheduled) and then we were only focussing on instant for the first part and the very next step will be to build the scheduled version. The interfaces were looking somewhat like these. </p>
