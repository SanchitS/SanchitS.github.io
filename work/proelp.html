                        <p>ProElp aims to remove the hassles and limitations of physical medical consultations. They are trying to bring all aspects of doctor consultations online, effectively minimizing the requirement of meeting a doctor in person. </p>

                        <p> It was my first internship as graphics, UI/UX designer. I joined the team in December 2015. That time it was an early startup which was growing it's branches and roots in the environment. First thing they asked me to make a logo as they wanted to launch the site ASAP.
                        </p>

                        <p> I took out pen and paper and started working on that. I send them some designs but they finalize one and wanted to improvise it.
                        </p>

                        <p> They selected this puzzle one as its final one and wanted to make some alterations on that so that the first and last 'p' will be easily readable. Tried many things and then finalize this one. Had some color fight but then the final match was made using these two colors and today the big logo looks like this

                        </p>

                        <p> It cost me 4 days and I was working with home. In the first week of january I visited the office for the first time. Too much positive energy was there, everyone was motivated to make this dream come true by giving the proper commitment and time. After getting introduced to every member of the team I started with the then required onboarding screens' graphics. I spent 5 hours in the office and prepared the sketches for the oboarding screens and after getting it finalized I started with the visual part using photoshop and illustrator. There were some last moment changes but those were done and screens were changed
                        </p>

                        <p> Now all the images can be seen on the app and the screenshots available on the playstore.
                        </p>

                        <p> Next step was to redesign the whole website of the proelp. Challenge was to retain the whole data that was available and to redesign the whole thing that it can pass the message and idea in more persuasive way. Did some research for it as it was officially my first UX project. Made some ideas on the pages and from the first point, started with the photoshop.
                        </p>

                        <p>And the first idea with adding the placeholders for the icons in the landing page, it was looking somewhat like this.
                        </p>

                        <p>Itâ€™s incomplete and never was completed as the team then decided to make some changes on the present one as it will cost so much of the time to start the new site from scratch. I ended that task here and wished to continue that in future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I never got a chance to do the UX part much as they were focusing on the MVP and wanted to keep it as simple as they can. But then too I did the UI part of the app which was little.
                        </p>

                        <p> Marketing guy wanted to take it further and to start the marketing of proelp at higher level and that time I was asigned with a task to design the brochures, pamphlets, kiosk and other things too. I did all those things and then I made personas for the posts and did some extra work too. All these work you can see here.

        <p>
            <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">OBJECTIVE - </span> To design a product which can solve the ambiguity and the problem of the online consultations with the doctors.</p>
            <p>Today people are skeptic about using the internet for the consultation of small health related problems and we know it very well that it can be solved with a little chat with the doctor without visiting him.</p>


            <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">BUSINESS NEEDS - </span>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>An Android app comprised of the new idea with the previous app's features glued in it.</li>
                <li>Chat based consultation with the elements of time left, notification, profile of doctor and sharing of the health record.(this is what we were focussing then and after the beta version and getting more users on board it will be transformed into the full chatting window with almost every social feature available online)</li>
                <li>To make the users use the other features of the app mainly filling up the health record and getting educated about the terms he filled in the health record.</li>
            </ul>


            <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">USER NEEDS - </span>If we can have a look over the internet and filtering out the play store and the android apps for India, then there are many apps already available like DocsApp, Lybrate, SeeDoc and many are growing like <a href="proelp.html">ProElp</a>, practo(starting this new feature), MeraDoctor, OyeHelp and much more. So what does user wants which are quite difficult for these contenders to provide? The reason is the stored health record.</p>
            <p>So the user needs a platform at which one can go at the time of emergency and instead of wasting time on filling up the information, he can directly go to the doctor and seek for help in minimum clicks and minimum time.

            <p>From the users' point of view, Health record is required which includes the book with the chapters like allergies, past medical history, lifestyle habits etc. and Vitals' information.</p>

            <p>Main work started from this point as after gathering all the information and doing some research I and my teammate <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/anindita-mandal-b4b4711b">Anindita Mandal</a> got out hands dirty with the flow of the new product. </p>
            <p>At this point we were focussing on both the ways of consultation as immediate one with the normal physician where the user will not be having choice and he will get the doctor randomly and another one was to schedule a consultation where according to the needs user can choose the doctor from the list where sorting and searching are available too.</p>
            <p>Prepared the rough flow first so that we can put the missing points in our bucket and can consider it later. After that the proper conceptual model with total information(although it does have some missing points at that point) was made.</p>

        <p>

            <p>After having a brainstorming session with two more people we stepped on the very next step to prepare the wireframes of the product. We were in a position to make the blueprint also but there were so many up-downs on the chart.</p>
            <p>Preparing the wireframes with the proper was my idea as instead of stepping directly onto the UIs I wanted to have a discussion over this low fidelity wireframes' flow. </p>
            <p>I know how to use the softwares like <b>Balsamiq, pencil, mockplus, axure</b> but I love to make the wireframes using pen-pencil-paper this is why I prepared this</p>

        <p>Now everything is done and now we have to focus on the high fidelity wireframes and UIs where the developers can get an idea and then they can proceed over what to build and how to build.</p>
        <p>Earlier we were focussing on both ways (instant and scheduled) and then we were only focussing on instant for the first part and the very next step will be to build the scheduled version. The interfaces were looking somewhat like these. </p>
