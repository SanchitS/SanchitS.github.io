                        <p>ProElp aims to remove the hassles and limitations of physical medical consultations. They are trying to bring all aspects of doctor consultations online, effectively minimizing the requirement of meeting a doctor in person. </p>

                        <p> It was my first internship as graphics, UI/UX designer. I joined the team in December 2015. That time it was an early startup which was growing it's branches and roots in the environment. First thing they asked me to make a logo as they wanted to launch the site ASAP.
                        </p>

                        <p> I took out pen and paper and started working on that. I send them some designs but they finalize one and wanted to improvise it.
                        </p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="centered col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 mt30 mb30 ">
                                <img class="ux-img img-responsive" src="../assets/img/proelp/logos.jpg">
                                <p class="ux-text">Ideas for the ProElp logo</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p> They selected this puzzle one(center left) as its final one and wanted to make some alterations on that so that the first and last 'p' will be easily readable. Tried many things and then finalize this one. Had some color fight but then the final match was made using these two colors and today the big logo looks like this

                        </p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="centered col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 mt30 mb30 ">

                        </div>

                        <p> It cost me 4 days and I was working with home. In the first week of january I visited the office for the first time. Too much positive energy was there, everyone was motivated to make this dream come true by giving the proper commitment and time. After getting introduced to every member of the team I started with the then required onboarding screens' graphics. I spent 5 hours in the office and prepared the sketches for the oboarding screens and after getting it finalized I started with the visual part using photoshop and illustrator. There were some last moment changes but those were done and screens were changed
                        </p>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="centered col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 mt30 mb30 ">

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="centered col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 mt30 mb30 ">
                                <img class="ux-img img-responsive" src="../assets/img/proelp/storyBoarding.jpg">
                                <p class="ux-text">Final Story boarding for both the apps.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>



                        <p> Now all the images can be seen on the app and the screenshots available on the playstore.
                        </p>

                        <p> Next step was to redesign the whole website of the proelp. Challenge was to retain the whole data that was available and to redesign the whole thing that it can pass the message and idea in more persuasive way. Did some research for it as it was officially my first UX project. Made some ideas on the pages and from the first point, started with the photoshop.
                        </p>


                        <p>And the first idea with adding the placeholders for the icons in the landing page, it was looking somewhat like this.
                        </p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="centered col-lg-6 col-lg-offset-3 col-md-6 col-md-offset-3 col-sm-6 col-sm-offset-3 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 mt30 mb30 ">
                                <img class="ux-img img-responsive" src="../assets/img/proelp/Website.jpg">
                                <p class="ux-text">First look of the website's redesign.</p>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>Itâ€™s incomplete and never was completed as the team then decided to make some changes on the present one as it will cost so much of the time to start the new site from scratch. I ended that task there and wished to continue that in future.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I never got a chance to do the UX part much as they were focusing on the MVP and wanted to keep it as simple as they can. But then too I did the UI part of the app which was little. for example the present look.
                        </p>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="centered col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-8 col-md-offset-2 col-sm-8 col-sm-offset-2 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1 mt30 mb30 ">

                        </div>

                        <p> Marketing guy wanted to take it further and to start the marketing of proelp at higher level and that time I was asigned with a task to design the brochures, pamphlets, kiosk and other things too. I did all those things and then I made personas for the posts and did some extra work too. All these work you can see here.
