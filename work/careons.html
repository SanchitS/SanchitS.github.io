                        <p>CareOns application is an attempt to digitize healthcare experience starting from comprehensive health record-keeping and patient education, helping in:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>organizing your health information and improving health care productivity</li>
                            <li>knowing about your health concerns through standardized and targeted patient education</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p> When I joined the team, CareOns' family was up to implementing a new idea and to develop a new product which can solve the problem of online consultations. By March, they already had more than 100s of downloads with 5 starred rating and everything was going good but the main focus of the minds of the startup was on this new product of the online consultation and the idea was to put the earlier careons app under this new app and make it a side product. Well that was the biggest challenge as now the main app's everything will be a by part of the new app and the new app's UI/UX should be persuasive enough with the feel of the previous version so that theses 100s of users will not get confused and can use this new app in a more efficient manner.

                    <p>
                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">OBJECTIVE - </span> To design a product which can solve the ambiguity and the problem of the online consultations with the doctors.</p>
                        <p>Today people are skeptic about using the internet for the consultation of small health related problems and we know it very well that it can be solved with a little chat with the doctor without visiting him.</p>


                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">BUSINESS NEEDS - </span>
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>An Android app comprised of the new idea with the previous app's features glued in it.</li>
                            <li>Chat based consultation with the elements of time left, notification, profile of doctor and sharing of the health record.(this is what we were focussing then and after the beta version and getting more users on board it will be transformed into the full chatting window with almost every social feature available online)</li>
                            <li>To make the users use the other features of the app mainly filling up the health record and getting educated about the terms he filled in the health record.</li>
                        </ul>


                        <p class="mt20"><span class="roboto500">USER NEEDS - </span>If we can have a look over the internet and filtering out the play store and the android apps for India, then there are many apps already available like DocsApp, Lybrate, SeeDoc and many are growing like <a href="proelp.html">ProElp</a>, practo(starting this new feature), MeraDoctor, OyeHelp and much more. So what does user wants which are quite difficult for these contenders to provide? The reason is the stored health record.</p>
                        <p>So the user needs a platform at which one can go at the time of emergency and instead of wasting time on filling up the information, he can directly go to the doctor and seek for help in minimum clicks and minimum time.

                        <p>Main work started from this point as after gathering all the information and doing some research I and my teammate <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/anindita-mandal-b4b4711b">Anindita Mandal</a> got out hands dirty with the flow of the new product. </p>
                        <p>At this point we were focussing on both the ways of consultation as immediate one with the normal physician where the user will not be having choice and he will get the doctor randomly and another one was to schedule a consultation where according to the needs user can choose the doctor from the list where sorting and searching are available too.</p>
                        <p>Prepared the rough flow first so that we can put the missing points in our bucket and can consider it later. After that the proper conceptual model with total information(although it does have some missing points at that point) was made.</p>

                        <p>After having a brainstorming session with two more people we stepped on the very next step to prepare the wireframes of the product. We were in a position to make the blueprint also but there were so many up-downs on the chart.</p>
                        <p>Preparing the wireframes with the proper was my idea as instead of stepping directly onto the UIs I wanted to have a discussion over this low fidelity wireframes' flow. </p>
                        <p>I know how to use the softwares like <b>Balsamiq, pencil, mockplus, axure</b> but I love to make the wireframes using pen-pencil-paper this is why I prepared this</p>

                    <p>Now everything is done and now we have to focus on the high fidelity wireframes and UIs where the developers can get an idea and then they can proceed over what to build and how to build.</p>
                    <p>Earlier we were focussing on both ways (instant and scheduled) and then we were only focussing on instant for the first part and the very next step will be to build the scheduled version. The interfaces were looking somewhat like these. </p>
